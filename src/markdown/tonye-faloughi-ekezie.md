Tonye Faloughi-Ekezie is a wife, mother and entrepreneur. As the
head of TEEOF Media, she consults on media and entertainment
projects for a range of clients.

In her early years Tonye attended school and university in the UK and USA, before eventually relocating back to Nigeria, working on, and commissioning major projects for such companies as Endemol South Africa, MNet and Storm 360. Imbibed with an entrepreneurial spirit from her father, Tonye started her own company, TEEOF Media, in 2011.

In 2012 Tonye married her best friend Ugo Ekezie and in 2013 they welcomed their first child, a boy, Ugo Jr., and in 2015 their second child, a girl, Simone. However, Simone had life threatening heart complications resulting from a late diagnosis of Down syndrome. As a result, Tonye and her family had to relocate to for the next two and a half years to save her daughter’s life.

In May 2018 with the good news of Simone’s heart functioning as normal, Tonye was able to return to Nigeria.

With the life lessons learnt and the experience of being a mother, she created the book series “Ugo and Sim Sim”, based on her children and has now turned her entrepreneurial drive to not only raising awareness about special needs, but also to children’s content after noticing a severe lack of entertainment representing black African children, special needs children and those who fall into both categories. 

Hence, the creation of “Simone’s Oasis”, a hub dedicated to black African children. Currently on all social media platforms and YouTube, kids can enjoy fun stories, books, music, videos, cartoons and more that have them fully represented! Parents are included too! Grown-ups will be able to join the Simone's Oasis community on everything parenting from how to potty train, to home schooling, to caring for a child with special needs.

The full Simone’s Oasis platform launches in the near future.
